These are the Qt project files.

Questions I had while making it:
What are the conditions for 'resetting'?
How should the user 'go back'? Just a back button on each page? Does the red 'X' in the corner suffice?
Should the currently open window time out and head back to the main window? Should the assignment window?
Am I allocating and de-allocating memory on the heap correctly?
How can I make the program prettier? It's pretty bland at the moment.
Are the text labels on the assignment page enough to manipulate from the database?
What about that map window that can show a bunch of parking spots?
